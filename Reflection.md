Facebookâ€™s recommendation is to follow these steps when building apps using React:

    Start with a mock
    Break the UI into a component hierarchy
    Build a static version in React
    Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state
    Identify where your state should live
    Add inverse data flow

1. Mock provided
2. Break UI into component hierarchy
3. Build a static version
4. Identify the minimal representation of UI state
